![MNIST Dataset](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/MnistExamples.png/320px-MnistExamples.png)

## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of an image recognition system for the MNIST dataset, a widely used benchmark in the field of machine learning. MNIST consists of a large collection of hand-written digits (0 to 9), making it an excellent dataset for developing and testing image classification algorithms.

## Features

- Preprocessing: Data loading, normalization, and augmentation.
- Model Architectures: Various neural network architectures for image classification.
- Training: Training scripts with adjustable hyperparameters.
- Evaluation: Model evaluation scripts and visualization tools.
- Inference: Inference scripts for deploying trained models.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/MNIST-Image-Recognition.git
   cd MNIST-Image-Recognition
   ```

2. Explore and run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory for training and evaluation.

3. Customize the models, hyperparameters, and data preprocessing to suit your specific needs.

## Usage

- Train your own models on MNIST data using the provided scripts.
- Evaluate model performance and visualize results.
- Deploy models for inference or integrate them into your applications.
